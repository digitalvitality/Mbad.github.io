    <h3>1. Types of Services Offered</h3>

    <h4>1.1. Engine Computer Programming</h4>
    <p>
      Engine Computer Programming involves the reprogramming of the Engine Control Module (ECM), Engine Control Unit (ECU), and Powertrain Control Module (PCM). These components govern various aspects of your vehicle's performance and efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reprogramming these units can enhance performance, improve fuel economy, and resolve emission-related issues. Our site provides detailed specifications, uses, and benefits of reprogramming under the 'Product Description' section.
    </p>

    <h4>1.2. PCM Repair and Testing</h4>
    <p>
      Our PCM Repair and Testing services begin with a complete diagnostic scan using advanced software tools to detect faults in your Powertrain Control Module (PCM). Once identified, our certified technicians perform the necessary repairs and run post-repair stress tests that simulate real driving conditions—ensuring complete restoration and reliability.
    </p>

    <h4>1.3. ECU Updates and Flashing</h4>
    <p>
      ECU flashing updates the software within your Engine Control Unit. Like a system update on a phone, this replaces outdated data with new programming to enhance engine output, improve fuel economy, and fix software glitches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most vehicles from the mid-1990s onward (OBD II compliant) are eligible for ECU flashing, including high-performance or modified cars. Contact us to confirm compatibility with your specific model.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Supported Vehicles</h3>
    <p>
      We specialize in module programming and flashing for a wide range of vehicles including Acura, Audi, BMW, Chrysler, Dodge, Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Jeep, Lexus, Mazda, Mercedes, Nissan, Toyota, Volkswagen, and many others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our technicians use the latest diagnostic tools to diagnose and repair these vehicles with precision and efficiency.
    </p>

    <hr style="margin: 40px 0;">

    <h3>3. Diagnostic Methods</h3>
    <p>
      We employ both software and physical diagnostics to ensure accuracy and completeness. Our proprietary diagnostic software reads Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) from your vehicle’s OBD system. Coupled with hands-on inspection, this approach uncovers both software and hardware issues within your control modules.
    </p>

    <hr style="margin: 40px 0;">

    <h3>4. PATS Key Reprogramming</h3>
    <p>
      The Passive Anti-Theft System (PATS) is essential for modern vehicle security. We reprogram transponder keys to communicate with your vehicle’s PATS, ensuring accurate key recognition and enabling proper ignition.
    </p>
    <p>
      This service is ideal for lost keys, non-starting issues, or adding new keys. We support Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury models equipped with PATS, with fast and reliable turnaround by our expert technicians.
